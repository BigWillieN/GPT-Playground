A minimum spanning tree is a tree in which each edge
is a minimum weight edge. The minimum spanning tree
gets rid of cycles and preserves only the minimum
weight edges while still maintaining all the vertices.

In single source shortest path, the graph is directed
and the overall goal is different. While in MST, we 
want to reach all vertices with the minimum amount
of total weight in our graph, in SSSP the goal is 
to reach the destination vertex with the minimum
amount of total weight.

A cut in a graph is a partition of the vertices into two disjoint sets. 
A light edge is an edge that has the minimum weight among all 
the edges crossing the cut. A safe edge is an edge that can be added to the current 
partial solution of an MST algorithm without creating a cycle.

They are greedy algorithms as we always start building
our path with the minimum weight edges in ascending order


Both algorithms are guaranteed to find the optimal solution to the MST problem. 
There is only one unique MST for a given graph, but there may be multiple ways to construct it.
